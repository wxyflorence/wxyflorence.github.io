I'm currently an associate professor (on the tenure track) at [School of Telecommunications Engineering](https://ste.xidian.edu.cn/), [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), and also a member of [the State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks](https://isn.xidian.edu.cn/).

I am also a Research Associate in the [National  Space Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](http://english.nssc.cas.cn/). (Jiuzhang Talent Program, Part-time) 

My group is recruiting master students. If interested, please send your resume and transcript to my e-mail.



Research Interest
======
My research interests include but not only limiting to
* Hyperspectral image processing (hyperspectral image classification, target detection, etc.)
* Multimodal information processing (multi-source remote sensing image fusion classification, zero-shot remote sensing scene classification, etc.)
* Computer vision for deep space exploration
* Deep learning and pattern recognition
